# ML_Child_Abuse_Detection
This is a Computer vision project that demostrates how it detects any form of child abuse by caretaker or any other personal.
Although it was specfically created for obeservation of the child in the situation where parents leave there children in the care
of a caretaker ,if any sort of harm happens to the chhild the app will immediately notify the parent with the time stamp on it ,this allows
them to be alerted imediately as well as the parents can use the timestamp to watch where this abuse started in the camera recording this could help them prvent
wasting time going through all the recordings everyday to see the condition of the child.

### The technologies used to build this
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Visual Studio code 
* Pytorch - For Object detection using YoloV5
* Yolov5 - for classification of adults and child
* Tensorflow - To build a custom neural network
* Anaconda -To manage different environemnts (Kafka,Django,ML project)
* Kafka - Used to integrate ML project and Django 
* Mediapipe
* Django
